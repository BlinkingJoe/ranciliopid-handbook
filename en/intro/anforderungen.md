## Central questions

### Do I dare to work with 230V? Am I aware of the risks?

You will alter and extend the cabeling installed in your machine, running at 230V. There is always the risk of life threatening electric shock, caused e.g. during assembly, by unsufficient insulation of electric connections, faulty cables etc. **You always have to be aware of this, everything you do is on your on risk!**

If you don't feel to be able or be unsure about what you are about to do, ask a professional to help you with the installation. We are happy to anser your questions, but can not take responsibility for the modification of your machine.

Of course, any existing warranty for your machine will be void.


### Am I encouraged to familiarise myself with the machine as well as the PID control

With PID control, you increase the complexity of your machine as there will be more parameters to change than before. This can lead to joy, but at the same time can also overtax you if things are not done systematically.

We offer standard parameters for the most common single boiler machines, therfore your coffee will improve even if you "only" install the PID and use the default parameters. However, with some knowledge about what and why the PID is doing, your results will improve. It pays off to invest some time to a) get to kow your machine better and b) understand the basic functions of the PID control
