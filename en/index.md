## Manual (english)

This is the manual for the Rancilio PID project which covers all the steps necessary for you own build.

It is highly recommended to read the introduction, which explains the requirements to be met for a successful upgrade of your machine with a PID. In addition, the abilities (and inabilities) of the PID are shown. The first step towards your own PID is ordering the parts from the provided list, which depends on the desired abilities of the PID as well as the already available equipment. While you are waiting for the parts to be shipped, there is time to install and set up the required software. Finally, all parts are assembled, flashed with the current software and integrated into your espresso machine and after successful testing you will find a plethora of customization options in the last chapter of the manual.

You can find more information about the project on the [Rancilio PID Website](http://rancilio-pid.de/).
